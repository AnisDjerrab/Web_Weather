#Web_Weather
A program that uses web scraping techniques to provide users with detailed weather information about my city.

It can extract the following data :

1) The current temperature.
2) The current wind speed.
3) The current humidity.
4) The current accumulated precipitation.
5) The current "feels-like" temperature.
6) The current date and time.
7) Weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
Thank you for giving it a try !
